# README for Encryption Application

## Overview
This application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting files using the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm. It is built with Python and Tkinter, and utilizes the `Cryptodome` library for encryption tasks.

## Features
- **File Encryption:** Allows users to select and encrypt files securely.
- **DES Encryption:** Utilizes the DES algorithm to ensure secure encryption of files.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)
- `pycryptodomex` library

## Installation

### Install Python
Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Required Libraries
Install the `pycryptodomex` library using pip:


## Usage

### Start the Application
Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:



### Encrypt a File
- Click on the "Browse" button to select the file you wish to encrypt.
- After selecting the file, click "Encrypt" to encrypt the file. The encrypted file will be saved in the same directory as the original.

## Security Note
This application uses the DES encryption algorithm, which is considered less secure than newer algorithms like AES. Use this application for educational purposes or for files that require a lower level of security.
